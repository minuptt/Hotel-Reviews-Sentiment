# Hotel-Reviews-Sentiment

## Introduction

This dataset is a part of hotel review dataset provided by Datafiniti's Business Database.
The original dataset was a list of over 35,000 reviews about the services of hotels they stayed in for a vacation, business trip, or any kind of trip from 2002 to 2017. It includes information such as hotel location, name, review rating, review text, title, username, and more.


The dataset needs to be pre-processed to identify outliers, missing values and analyzing further to determine the features relevant to the requirements. After that, I have the final dataset for sentiment analysis with 34,690 rows and 2 coloumns (review text and review rating). The scale of rating is from 1 to 5.
